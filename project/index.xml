      <description>Anomalies in high-energy physics are almost always judged by (global) $p$-values and significances. I propose that we instead judge anomalies using so-called Bayes factors. I applied this to indirect searches for dark matter by DAMPE and the 750 GeV diphoton excess.
Summarising Berger et al, 2001,
 Bayes factors are easy to understand - $p$-values, on the other hand, are frequently misinterpreted, even by scientists. Bayes factors may be applied to more than two models, non-nested models and cases in which asymptotic formulae cannot apply.</description>

      <description>During my PhD I was involved with BayesFits, lead by Prof. Roszkowski. We published high-impact analyses of simple SUSY models in light of LHC searches for SUSY and the Higgs discovery [1, 2, 3].</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning and naturalness</title>

      <description>Fine-tuning of the weak-scale was traditionally measured by the Barbieri-Giudice measure $$ \Delta = \frac{\partial\ln M_Z^2}{\partial \ln m_{\textrm{soft}}} $$ In a series of papers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], I have argued that our intuitve ideas about fine-tuning are captured formally in Bayesian statistics.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty in the Dark Matter Velocity Profile</title>
      <link>https://andrewfowlie.github.io/project/max_entropy_profile/</link>

      <description>Direct detection experiments search for dark matter in interactions with detectors on earth. The relative velocity of dark matter with respect to the detectors is, however, unknown. In [1], we pioneered the use of Quantified Maximum Entropy (see e.g., Skilling) to model the uncertainty in the velocity distribution and applied it to DAMA/LIBRA. In [2] we developed a novel numerical approximation and applied it to XENON1T.
In both works, we constructed an entropic prior for the velocity distribution, $$ p(f) \propto e^{\beta S[f, m]}, $$ where $\beta$ is a hyperparameter governing the strength of our belief in the default distribution, $m$, and $$ S[f, m] = \int f(v) \ln\left(\frac{f(v)}{m(v)}\right) dv $$ is the relative entropy between the distributions $f$ and $m$.</description>

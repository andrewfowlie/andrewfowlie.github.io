      <description>Anomalies in high-energy physics are almost always judged by (global) $p$-values and significances. I propose that we instead judge anomalies using so-called Bayes factors. I applied this to indirect searches for dark matter by DAMPE and the 750 GeV diphoton excess.
Summarising Berger et al, 2001,
 Bayes factors are easy to understand - p-values, on the other hand, are frequently misinterpreted, even by scientists. Bayes factors may be applied to more than two models, non-nested models and cases in which asymptotic formulae cannot apply.</description>

      <description>During my PhD I was involved with BayesFits, lead by Prof. Roszkowski. We published high-impact analyses of simple SUSY models in light of LHC searches for SUSY and the Higgs discovery [1, 2, 3].</description>

      <title>Uncertainty in the Dark Matter Velocity Profile</title>

      <description>Direct detection experiments search for dark matter in interactions with detectors on earth. The relative velocity of dark matter with respect to the detectors is, however, unknown. In [1], we pioneered the use of Quantified Maximum Entropy to model the uncertainty in the velocity distribution.</description>

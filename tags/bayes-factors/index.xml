      <description>Anomalies in high-energy physics are almost always judged by (global) $p$-values and significances. I propose that we instead judge anomalies using so-called Bayes factors. I applied this to indirect searches for dark matter by DAMPE and the 750 GeV diphoton excess.
Summarising Berger et al, 2001,
 Bayes factors are easy to understand - p-values, on the other hand, are frequently misinterpreted, even by scientists. Bayes factors may be applied to more than two models, non-nested models and cases in which asymptotic formulae cannot apply.</description>

      <description>Fine-tuning of the weak-scale was traditionally measured by the Barbieri-Giudice measure $$ \Delta = \frac{\partial\ln M_Z^2}{\partial \ln m_{\textrm{soft}}} $$ In a series of papers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], I have argued that our intuitve ideas about fine-tuning are captured formally in Bayesian statistics.</description>

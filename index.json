Working in a framework where the neutralinos and charginos are the only light sparticles in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, we use GAMBIT to perform a detailed likelihood analysis of the electroweakino sector.  We focus on the impacts of recent ATLAS and CMS searches with 36/fb of 13 TeV proton-proton collision data. We also include constraints from LEP and invisible decays of the $Z$ and Higgs bosons.  Under the background-only hypothesis, we show that current LHC searches do not robustly exclude any range of neutralino or chargino masses. However, a pattern of excesses in several LHC analyses points towards a possible signal, with neutralino masses of ($m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_1^0}$, $m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_2^0}$, $m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_3^0}$, $m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_4^0}$) =  (8--155, 103--260, 130--473, 219--502) GeV and chargino masses of ($m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_1^{\\pm}}$, $m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_2^{\\pm}}$) = (104--259, 224--507) GeV at the 95% confidence level. The lightest neutralino is mostly bino, with a possible modest Higgsino or wino component. We find that this excess has a combined local significance of $3.3\\sigma$, subject to a number of cautions. If one includes LHC searches for charginos and neutralinos conducted with 8 TeV proton-proton collision data, the local significance is lowered to $2.9\\sigma$. We briefly consider the implications for dark matter, finding that the correct relic density can be obtained through the Higgs-funnel and $Z$-funnel mechanisms, even assuming that all other sparticles are decoupled. All samples, GAMBIT input files and best-fit models from this study are available on Zenodo.","tags":null,"title":"Combined collider constraints on neutralinos and charginos","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564502400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565166060,"objectID":"57382c8b99da015cac70dcdb07a38a19","permalink":"/talk/phystat_dm_2019/","publishdate":"2019-07-31T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/phystat_dm_2019/","section":"talk","summary":"I discuss findings from my recent comparison of Bayesian and frequentist approaches to resonance searches ([1902.03243](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03243)).

Anomalies in high-energy physics are almost always judged by (global) $p$-values and significances. I propose that we instead judge anomalies using so-called Bayes factors. I applied this to indirect searches for dark matter by DAMPE and the 750 GeV diphoton excess.\nSummarising Berger et al, 2001,\n Bayes factors are easy to understand - $p$-values, on the other hand, are frequently misinterpreted, even by scientists. Bayes factors may be applied to more than two models, non-nested models and cases in which asymptotic formulae cannot apply. Bayes factors include an automatic Occam\u0026rsquo;s razor, punishing e.g., fine-tuning.  Bayes factors are ratios of evidences, $$ \\text{BF} = \\frac{\\text{Evidence for model $A$}}{\\text{Evidence for model $B$}}, $$ where an evidence is the probability of our observed data given a particular model. Bayes factors update our relative belief in models in light of experimental data, $$ \\text{Relative belief after data} = \\text{BF} \\times \\text{Relative belief before data}. $$ For example, a Bayes factor of ten in favour of model $A$ means that it is ten times more plausible relative to model $B$ than it was before our experiment.\nThere are many interesting discussions about the merits of Bayes factors at Bayesian Spectacles. For an early discussion, see Rozeboom, 1960.\nIt is often remarked that $p$-values overstate the evidence against the null (see e.g. Berger \u0026amp; Selke, 1987). I investigated this in the context of resonance searches at the LHC, finding that indeed $p$-values could overstate the evidence against the background-only model by about $1\\sigma$ in that setting.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635923021,"objectID":"334946358c62f095353a05dbfa57ac6f","permalink":"/project/bayes_factors/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/bayes_factors/","section":"project","summary":"Anomalies in high-energy physics with Bayes factors","tags":null,"title":"Bayes factors","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"During my PhD I was involved with BayesFits, lead by Prof. Roszkowski.

Two preliminary ideas are the $\\sqrt{s}=33$ TeV HE-LHC and the $\\sqrt{s}=100$ TeV VLHC. With Bayesian statistics, we calculate the probabilities that the LHC, HE-LHC and VLHC discover SUSY in the future, assuming that nature is described by the CMSSM and given the experimental data from the LHC, LUX and Planck. We find that the LHC with 300/fb at $\\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV has a 15-75% probability of discovering SUSY. Should that run fail to discover SUSY, the probability of discovering SUSY with 3000/fb is merely 1-10%. Were SUSY to remain undetected at the LHC, the HE-LHC would have a 35-85% probability of discovering SUSY with 3000/fb. The VLHC, on the other hand, ought to be definitive; the probability of it discovering SUSY, assuming that the CMSSM is the correct model, is 100%.","tags":null,"title":"Prospects for constrained supersymmetry at $\\sqrt{s}=33$ TeV and $\\sqrt{s}=100$ TeV proton-proton super-colliders","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555487802,"objectID":"9fe1701e3cb0d688483cdc89724a6717","permalink":"/talk/tallinn_1/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/tallinn_1/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Bayes vs chi-squared","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1380988800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635923021,"objectID":"68b35174cdb1d69cd24af035b1d38cd5","permalink":"/talk/tmex/","publishdate":"2013-10-06T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/tmex/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian Reconstruction of SUSY parameters at $\\sqrt{s} = 14\\,\\text{GeV}$ via the Golden Decay","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1365436800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635923021,"objectID":"481736d4f3db471576eb8de4911a7e7f","permalink":"/talk/iop_susy/","publishdate":"2013-04-09T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/iop_susy/","section":"talk","summary":"In light of the failed supersymmetry searches at the LHC, with Bayesian statistics, I discuss:  Where is supersymmetry?, and, Is the most constrained supersymmetry model still viable?

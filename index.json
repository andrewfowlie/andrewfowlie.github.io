When multiple experimental results are considered, as in global fits, a composite likelihood function is used, constructed from likelihood components for all the measurements included in the fit. In most cases the formulation of a likelihood function necessarily involves some approximations. In this talk we will discuss some challenges and subtleties associated with the construction and use of approximate likelihood functions. In particular, we consider how different levels of detail in the likelihood information can impact the results of global fits, and the associated computational expense.","tags":null,"title":"Pitfalls in likelihood land","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Csaba Balázs","Melissa van Beekveld","Sascha Caron","Barry M.

Many models in particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology fall into one or both of these categories. These issues are often sidestepped with very simplistic and statistically unsound ad hoc methods, involving naive intersection of parameter intervals estimated by multiple experiments, and random or grid sampling of model parameters. Whilst these methods are easy to apply, they exhibit pathologies even in low-dimensional parameter spaces, and quickly become problematic to use and interpret in higher dimensions. In this article we give clear guidance for going beyond these rudimentary procedures, suggesting some simple methods for performing statistically sound inference, and recommendations of readily-available software tools and standards that can assist in doing so. Our aim is to provide physicists with recommendations for reaching correct scientific conclusions, with only a modest increase in analysis burden.","tags":null,"title":"Simple and statistically sound strategies for analysing physical theories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew Fowlie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1607472000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609726891,"objectID":"c52191e7c24ed31d26022b706d34796f","permalink":"/publication/jl_paradox/","publishdate":"2020-12-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jl_paradox/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider the Jeffreys-Lindley paradox from an objective Bayesian perspective by attempting to find priors representing complete indifference to sample size in the problem. This means that we ensure that the prior for the unknown mean and the prior predictive for the $t$-statistic are independent of the sample size. If successful, this would lead to Bayesian model comparison that was independent of sample size and ameliorate the paradox. Unfortunately, it leads to an improper scale-invariant prior for the unknown mean. We show, however, that a truncated scale-invariant prior delays the dependence on sample size, which could be practically significant. Lastly, we shed light on the paradox by relating it to the fact that the scale-invariant prior is improper.","tags":null,"title":"Objective Bayesian approach to the Jeffreys-Lindley paradox","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew Fowlie","Will Handley","Liangliang Su"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603670400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609726891,"objectID":"e68aecbac9aa5835623b09527ac9002a","permalink":"/publication/nested_sampling_plateaus/","publishdate":"2020-10-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nested_sampling_plateaus/","section":"publication","summary":"It was recently shown by Riley (2019); Schittenhelm \u0026 Wacker (2020) that in the presence of plateaus in the likelihood function nested sampling (NS) produces faulty estimates of the evidence and posterior densities.

Working in a framework where the neutralinos and charginos are the only light sparticles in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, we use GAMBIT to perform a detailed likelihood analysis of the electroweakino sector.  We focus on the impacts of recent ATLAS and CMS searches with 36/fb of 13 TeV proton-proton collision data. We also include constraints from LEP and invisible decays of the $Z$ and Higgs bosons.  Under the background-only hypothesis, we show that current LHC searches do not robustly exclude any range of neutralino or chargino masses. However, a pattern of excesses in several LHC analyses points towards a possible signal, with neutralino masses of ($m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_1^0}$, $m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_2^0}$, $m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_3^0}$, $m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_4^0}$) =  (8--155, 103--260, 130--473, 219--502) GeV and chargino masses of ($m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_1^{\\pm}}$, $m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_2^{\\pm}}$) = (104--259, 224--507) GeV at the 95% confidence level. The lightest neutralino is mostly bino, with a possible modest Higgsino or wino component. We find that this excess has a combined local significance of $3.3\\sigma$, subject to a number of cautions. If one includes LHC searches for charginos and neutralinos conducted with 8 TeV proton-proton collision data, the local significance is lowered to $2.9\\sigma$. We briefly consider the implications for dark matter, finding that the correct relic density can be obtained through the Higgs-funnel and $Z$-funnel mechanisms, even assuming that all other sparticles are decoupled.

We chart the change in the Bayesian posterior of the background only model and the global p-value. We find that, as anticipated, the posterior converges to certainty about the model as luminosity increases. The p-value, on the other hand, randomly walks between 0 and 1 under the background only model. After briefly commenting on the frequentist properties of the posterior, we make a direct comparison of the significances obtained in Bayesian and frequentist frameworks. We find that the well-known look-elsewhere effect reduces local significances by about 1$\\sigma$. We furthermore find a previously unknown effect: significances from our Bayesian framework are typically about 1 to 2$\\sigma$ smaller than the global significances. This suggests that even global significances could significantly overstate the evidence against the background only model. This effect - the Bayes effect - could radically change our interpretation of the evidence for new physics in resonance searches.

Working in a framework where the neutralinos and charginos are the only light sparticles in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, we use GAMBIT to perform a detailed likelihood analysis of the electroweakino sector. We focus on the impacts of recent ATLAS and CMS searches with 36 fb$^{-1}$ of 13 TeV proton-proton collision data. We also include constraints from LEP and invisible decays of the $Z$ and Higgs bosons. Under the background-only hypothesis, we show that current LHC searches do not robustly exclude any range of neutralino or chargino masses. However, a pattern of excesses in several LHC analyses points towards a possible signal, with neutralino masses of $(m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_1^0}, m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_2^0}, m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_3^0}, m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_4^0})$ = (8-155, 103-260, 130-473, 219-502) GeV and chargino masses of $(m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_1^{\\pm}}, m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_2^{\\pm}})$ = (104-259, 224-507) GeV at the 95% confidence level. The lightest neutralino is mostly bino, with a possible modest Higgsino or wino component. We find that this excess has a combined local significance of $3.5\\sigma$, subject to a number of cautions. We briefly consider the implications for dark matter, finding that the correct relic density can be obtained through the Higgs-funnel and $Z$-funnel mechanisms, even assuming that all other sparticles are decoupled.

Our analysis includes up-to-date likelihood functions for the dark matter relic density, invisible Higgs decays, and direct and indirect searches for weakly-interacting dark matter including the latest XENON1T data. We also account for important uncertainties arising from the local density and velocity distribution of dark matter, nuclear matrix elements relevant to direct detection, and Standard Model masses and couplings. In all Higgs portal models, we find parameter regions that can explain all of dark matter and give a good fit to all data. The case of vector dark matter requires the most tuning and is therefore slightly disfavoured from a Bayesian point of view. In the case of fermionic dark matter, we find a strong preference for including a CP-violating phase that allows suppression of constraints from direct detection experiments, with odds in favour of CP violation of the order of 100:1.

The entropic prior contains an a priori unknown regularisation factor, $\\beta$, that describes the strength of our conviction that the profile is approximately Maxwellian. By varying $\\beta$, we smoothly interpolate between a halo-independent and a halo-dependent analysis, thus exploring the impact of prior information about the DM profile.","tags":null,"title":"Halo-independence with quantified maximum entropy at DAMA/LIBRA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefano Di Chiara","Andrew Fowlie","Sean Fraser","Carlo Marzo","Luca Marzola","Martti Raidal","Christian Spethmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1492646400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555487802,"objectID":"77e83dcd5847eecf5a3a0e0c8f3d3e45","permalink":"/publication/bphys/","publishdate":"2017-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bphys/","section":"publication","summary":"There has been a steady interest in flavor anomalies and their global fits as ideal probes of new physics. If the anomalies are real, one promising explanation is a new $Z^\\prime$ gauge boson with flavor-changing coupling to bottom and strange quarks and a flavor-conserving coupling to muons and, possibly, electrons. We point out that direct production of such a $Z^\\prime$, emerging from the collision of $b$ and $s$ quarks, may offer a complementary window into these phenomena because collider searches already provide competitive constraints. On top of that, we analyse the same $Z^\\prime$ scenario in relation to another long-standing discrepancy between theory and experiment that concerns the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. By scanning the allowed $Z^\\prime$ coupling strengths in the low-mass region, we assess the compatibility of the signals from LHCb with the $Z^\\prime$ searches in the high energy LHC data and the measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the involved leptons. We also argue that observations of the latter can break the degeneracy pattern in the Wilson coefficients $C\\_9$ and $C\\_{10}$ presented by LHCb data. The $Z^\\prime$ model we consider is compatible with the new measurement of $R_{K^\\star}$, therefore it can potentially account for the long-standing deviations observed in $B$-physics.","tags":null,"title":"Minimal flavor-changing $Z^\\prime$ models and muon $g−2$ after the $R_{K^\\star}$ measurement","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1480348800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555487802,"objectID":"8deb07e99886a346ef727743c51c3f34","permalink":"/talk/cospa_relaxion/","publishdate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/cospa_relaxion/","section":"talk","summary":"The relaxion mechanism is a novel solution to the hierarchy problem that utilizes the dynamics of an axion-like field.

After sampling its parameter space, we identify three benchmark points with a PT at about $T \\approx 10^7$ GeV in a gauge singlet extension of the SM. We calculate the nucleation temperature, order parameter, characteristic timescale, and peak amplitude and frequency of GW from bubble collisions during the PT for the benchmarks and find that, in an optimistic scenario, GW from such a PT may be in reach of aLIGO (O5). We confirm that the singlet stabilizes the electroweak vacuum whilst remaining consistent with zero-temperature phenomenology as well.

Anomalies in high-energy physics are almost always judged by (global) $p$-values and significances. I propose that we instead judge anomalies using so-called Bayes factors. I applied this to indirect searches for dark matter by DAMPE and the 750 GeV diphoton excess.\nSummarising Berger et al, 2001,\n Bayes factors are easy to understand - $p$-values, on the other hand, are frequently misinterpreted, even by scientists. Bayes factors may be applied to more than two models, non-nested models and cases in which asymptotic formulae cannot apply. Bayes factors include an automatic Occam\u0026rsquo;s razor, punishing e.g., fine-tuning.  Bayes factors are ratios of evidences, $$ \\text{BF} = \\frac{\\text{Evidence for model $A$}}{\\text{Evidence for model $B$}}, $$ where an evidence is the probability of our observed data given a particular model. Bayes factors update our relative belief in models in light of experimental data, $$ \\text{Relative belief after data} = \\text{BF} \\times \\text{Relative belief before data}. $$ For example, a Bayes factor of ten in favour of model $A$ means that it is ten times more plausible relative to model $B$ than it was before our experiment.\nThere are many interesting discussions about the merits of Bayes factors at Bayesian Spectacles. For an early discussion, see Rozeboom, 1960.\nIt is often remarked that $p$-values overstate the evidence against the null (see e.g. Berger \u0026amp; Selke, 1987). I investigated this in the context of resonance searches at the LHC, finding that indeed $p$-values could overstate the evidence against the background-only model by about $1\\sigma$ in that setting.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551793579,"objectID":"334946358c62f095353a05dbfa57ac6f","permalink":"/project/bayes_factors/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/bayes_factors/","section":"project","summary":"Anomalies in high-energy physics with Bayes factors","tags":null,"title":"Bayes factors","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"During my PhD I was involved with BayesFits, lead by Prof. Roszkowski.

This time around, however, the mood in the high-energy physics community is pessimistic. There is a growing suspicion that naturalness arguments that predict new physics near the weak scale are faulty and that prospects for a new discovery are limited. We argue that such doubts originate from a misunderstanding of the foundations of naturalness arguments. In spite of the first run at the LHC, which aggravated the little-hierarchy problem, there is no cause for doubting naturalness or natural theories. Naturalness is grounded in Bayesian probability logic - it is not a scientific theory and it makes no sense to claim that it could be falsified or that it is under pressure from experimental data. We should remain optimistic about discovery prospects; natural theories, such as supersymmetry, generally predict new physics close to the weak scale. Furthermore, from a Bayesian perspective, we briefly discuss 't Hooft's technical naturalness and a contentious claim that the little-hierarchy problem hints that the Standard Model is a fundamental theory.","tags":null,"title":"The little-hierarchy problem is a little problem: understanding the  difference between the big- and little-hierarchy problems with Bayesian  probability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew Fowlie","Luca Marzola"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1418774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555487802,"objectID":"ae4935e5c19155c445768de7357aab08","permalink":"/publication/lr_2/","publishdate":"2014-12-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lr_2/","section":"publication","summary":"Encouraged by a hint in a search for right-handed $W$ bosons at the LHC, we investigate whether the unitarity of a right-handed quark mixing matrix and the equality of the left- and right-handed quark mixing matrices could be tested at the LHC.

Preliminary introductions to relevant supersymmetry phenomenology, Bayesian statistics and algorithms, and comprehensive descriptions of likelihood functions for experimental results are provided. Likelihood functions for searches for supersymmetry at the LHC are built at the event-level from Monte-Carlo simulations, including CMS 35/pb, 1.1/fb and 4.4/fb searches. Five studies of different supersymmetric models, including the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM), the Non-Universal Higgs Model, the Non-Universal Gaugino Model and phenomenological MSSM models, and for different states of knowledge, including hypothetical benchmark scenarios, and pre- and post-Higgs discovery, are comprehensively presented. Credible regions for model parameters, Bayesian evidences, best-fit points and $p$-values are calculated in each study. We demonstrate that the CMSSM's soft-breaking masses could be determined from LHC searches with 100/fb at 14 TeV for a specific favourable choice of parameters consistent with all current constraints.

The null result excludes (at 95% CL) a low-mass region of the Constrained MSSM's parameter space that was previously favored by other experiments. Additionally, the negative result of the XENON100 dark matter search has excluded (at 90% CL) values of the spin-independent scattering cross sections $\\sigma^\\text{SI}\\_p$ as low as $10^{-8}$ pb. We incorporate these improved experimental constraints into a global Bayesian fit of the Constrained MSSM by constructing approximate likelihood functions. In the case of the alphaT limit, we simulate detector efficiency for the CMS $\\alpha\\_T$ 1.1/fb and validate our method against the official 95% CL contour. We identify the 68% and 95% credible posterior regions of the CMSSM parameters, and also find the best-fit point. We find that the credible regions change considerably once a likelihood from $\\alpha\\_T$ is included, in particular the narrow light Higgs resonance region becomes excluded, but the focus point/horizontal branch region remains allowed at the $1\\sigma$ level. Adding the limit from XENON100 has a weaker additional effect, in part due to large uncertainties in evaluating $\\sigma^\\text{SI}\\_p$, which we include in a conservative way, although we find that it reduces the posterior probability of the focus point region to the $2\\sigma$ level. The new regions of high posterior favor squarks lighter than the gluino and all but one Higgs bosons heavy. The dark matter neutralino mass is found in the range 250 GeV $\\lesssim m\\_\\chi \\lesssim$ 343 GeV (at $1\\sigma$) while, as the result of improved limits from the LHC, the favored range of $\\sigma^\\text{SI}\\_p$ is pushed down to values below $10^{-9}$ pb.

With Monte-Carlo, we simulate sparticle production and subsequent golden decay at the event level and perform pseudo-measurements of sparticle masses from kinematic endpoints in invariant mass distributions. We find that two lightest neutralino masses and the first and second generation left-handed slepton and squark masses could be rather precisely measured with correlated uncertainties. We investigate whether from such measurements one could determine the CMSSM's Lagrangian parameters by including a likelihood from our pseudo-measurements of sparticle masses in a Bayesian analysis of the CMSSM's parameter space. We find that the CMSSM's parameters can be accurately determined, with the exception of the common trilinear parameter. Experimental measurements of the relic density by Planck and the Higgs boson's mass slightly improve this determination, especially for the common trilinear parameter.

Working in a framework where the neutralinos and charginos are the only light sparticles in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, we use GAMBIT to perform a detailed likelihood analysis of the electroweakino sector.  We focus on the impacts of recent ATLAS and CMS searches with 36/fb of 13 TeV proton-proton collision data. We also include constraints from LEP and invisible decays of the $Z$ and Higgs bosons.  Under the background-only hypothesis, we show that current LHC searches do not robustly exclude any range of neutralino or chargino masses. However, a pattern of excesses in several LHC analyses points towards a possible signal, with neutralino masses of ($m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_1^0}$, $m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_2^0}$, $m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_3^0}$, $m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_4^0}$) =  (8--155, 103--260, 130--473, 219--502) GeV and chargino masses of ($m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_1^{\\pm}}$, $m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_2^{\\pm}}$) = (104--259, 224--507) GeV at the 95% confidence level. The lightest neutralino is mostly bino, with a possible modest Higgsino or wino component. We find that this excess has a combined local significance of $3.3\\sigma$, subject to a number of cautions. If one includes LHC searches for charginos and neutralinos conducted with 8 TeV proton-proton collision data, the local significance is lowered to $2.9\\sigma$. We briefly consider the implications for dark matter, finding that the correct relic density can be obtained through the Higgs-funnel and $Z$-funnel mechanisms, even assuming that all other sparticles are decoupled. All samples, GAMBIT input files and best-fit models from this study are available on Zenodo.","tags":null,"title":"Combined collider constraints on neutralinos and charginos","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564502400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1763094853,"objectID":"57382c8b99da015cac70dcdb07a38a19","permalink":"/talk/phystat_dm_2019/","publishdate":"2019-07-31T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/phystat_dm_2019/","section":"talk","summary":"I discuss findings from my recent comparison of Bayesian and frequentist approaches to resonance searches ([1902.03243](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03243)).

Below about 60 GeV, the limit weakens by less than an order of magnitude if we assume an isotropic distribution in the galactic frame. If we permit anisotropic distributions, the limit further weakens, but at most by about two orders of magnitude.

Furthermore, we contrast our Bayesian analyses with traditional fine-tuning measures based upon derivatives of the $Z$-boson mass, including high- and low-scale measures, highlighting deficiencies in traditional fine-tuning measures.","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian naturalness of Next-to-Minimal and Minimal Supersymmetric Models","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Is it permitted for a physicist to join the fun in this Neo-Bayesian vs. orthodox fight? Anomalies in high-energy physics are almost always judged by (global) $p$-values and significances. I propose that we instead judge anomalies using so-called Bayes factors. I applied this to indirect searches for dark matter by DAMPE and the 750 GeV diphoton excess.\nSummarising Berger et al, 2001,\n Bayes factors are easy to understand - $p$-values, on the other hand, are frequently misinterpreted, even by scientists. Bayes factors may be applied to more than two models, non-nested models and cases in which asymptotic formulae cannot apply. Bayes factors include an automatic Occam\u0026rsquo;s razor, punishing e.g., fine-tuning.  Bayes factors are ratios of evidences, $$ \\text{BF} = \\frac{\\text{Evidence for model $A$}}{\\text{Evidence for model $B$}}, $$ where an evidence is the probability of our observed data given a particular model. Bayes factors update our relative belief in models in light of experimental data, $$ \\text{Relative belief after data} = \\text{BF} \\times \\text{Relative belief before data}. $$ For example, a Bayes factor of ten in favour of model $A$ means that it is ten times more plausible relative to model $B$ than it was before our experiment.\nThere are many interesting discussions about the merits of Bayes factors at Bayesian Spectacles. For an early discussion, see Rozeboom, 1960.\nIt is often remarked that $p$-values overstate the evidence against the null (see e.g. Berger \u0026amp; Selke, 1987). I investigated this in the context of resonance searches at the LHC, finding that indeed $p$-values could overstate the evidence against the background-only model by about $1\\sigma$ in that setting.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635923021,"objectID":"334946358c62f095353a05dbfa57ac6f","permalink":"/project/bayes_factors/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/bayes_factors/","section":"project","summary":"Anomalies in high-energy physics with Bayes factors","tags":null,"title":"Bayes factors","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"During my PhD I was involved with BayesFits, lead by Prof. Roszkowski.

The relative velocity of dark matter with respect to the detectors is, however, unknown. In [1], we pioneered the use of Quantified Maximum Entropy (see e.g., Skilling) to model the uncertainty in the velocity distribution and applied it to DAMA/LIBRA. In [2] we developed a novel numerical approximation and applied it to XENON1T.\nIn both works, we constructed an entropic prior for the velocity distribution, $$ p(f) \\propto e^{\\beta S[f, m]}, $$ where $\\beta$ is a hyperparameter governing the strength of our belief in the default distribution, $m$, and $$ S[f, m] = \\int f(v) \\ln\\left(\\frac{f(v)}{m(v)}\\right) dv $$ is the relative entropy between the distributions $f$ and $m$.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635923021,"objectID":"c7c31d92c4e729923e39e2e422cb2af9","permalink":"/project/max_entropy_profile/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/max_entropy_profile/","section":"project","summary":"Using Quantified Maximum Entropy to model uncertainty in the dark matter velocity profile.","tags":null,"title":"Uncertainty in the Dark Matter Velocity Profile","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1455552000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1763094853,"objectID":"db33d4885076256e6a3f7523c7c83802","permalink":"/talk/coepp_relaxion/","publishdate":"2016-02-16T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/coepp_relaxion/","section":"talk","summary":"The relaxion mechanism is a novel solution to the hierarchy problem that utilizes the dynamics of an axion-like field.
